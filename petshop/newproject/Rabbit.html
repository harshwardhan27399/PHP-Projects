        <td>The American Rabbit is a breed of rabbit, recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) in 1917. By the ARBA standard, American rabbits have a mandolin body shape and a coat ideal for use as fur.[1] It has also been noted for a good 'sweet' temperament and good mothering abilities.[2] As with all domestic rabbits, the American breed is of the species Oryctolagus cuniculus, the European wild rabbit.</td>

        <td>Chinchilla rabbits</td>
        <td>Chinchilla rabbits are a group of three rabbit breeds that have been bred for a coat that resembles that of chinchillas.[1] Despite their name, they are not related to and cannot interbreed with chinchillas, which are a species of rodent. Rabbits are lagomorphs. A mutation diluted the yellow pigment in the hairs to almost white, changing in this way the color of the fur of the wild rabbit (agouti) into chinchilla.</td>

However, the American Fuzzy Lop is a wool breed and will have wool similar to the Angora breeds although the wool will be shorter than that of a commercial Angora. The American fuzzy lop has to weigh up to 4 pounds in order to be shown. </td>
