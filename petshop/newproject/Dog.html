The dogs that developed in the southern and western desert regions tend to be light in color and have a sparse coat. The dogs from the north are more compact, darker, and with thicker coats. 
The Afghan hound is the most known dog breed from Afghanistan, but there is also the Afghan Shepherd, or Kuchi. This is a herding and guard dog that follows nomads on their travels.</td>

        <td>The Australian Cattle Dog is often called ACD, or just cattle dog, and these are energetic cattle herders ready to work all day. In their home land Australia these dogs drive cattle across long distances over rough terrain, and they are  unfazed by angry cows. An individual with strong herding instinct can get the idea to herd anything that moves.
Australian Cattle Dogs are agile, curious, strong, and intelligent. They consistently score amongst the ten most intelligent breeds. They generally also have a lot of energy, and paired with bright minds this means they need something to do. Bring the ACD along on adventures, jogging, hiking, or whatever the family is up to.</td>

The breed stems back to the 1800s and were originally used as herders, watchdogs, and companions. Their smarts and versatility soon made them popular outside the country of origin, and early on the Groenendaels served as police dogs in Paris and New York City, and they were famous for catching smugglers for Belgian customs.

The ancestors to the Bloodhound are believed to stem from the Mediterranean countries, and came to western Europe from Constantinople. At the time there were two strains; black or white. The black dogs were known as the Chien de Saint-Hubert and were bred by monks at the Saint-Hubert Monestary in Belgium. The white dogs became known as Southern Hounds. The breed reached its modern form in England.
