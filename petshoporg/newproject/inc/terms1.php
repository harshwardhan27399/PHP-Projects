Adoption: 
	I, the above named adopter, hereby agree to adopt the pet as described above (the “Pet”) and pay the non-refundable adoption fee, and agree to the terms and conditions as set out in this agreement.

General welfare: 
	I agree to provide the Pet with good and humane care, and agree that I shall not do anything to the Pet which may be construed as animal abuse. The Pet shall be a house pet/companion only and not be used for any other purposes. I agree to provide the Pet, when required, with adequate and timely medical care by a licensed veterinarian, including (where applicable) vaccinations, regular check-ups, emergency care, as well as other treatments as may be recommended by the vet. The first set of vaccinations and deworming after adoption will be done at Real Care Small Animal Clinic by me.

No Breeding: 
	I acknowledge and agree that breeding of the Pet is strictly forbidden. Where the Pet is a cat or a dog and has not been sterilized, I agree to arrange for the Pet to be sterilized at Real Care Small Animal Clinic within 30 days from the date of the adoption or upon sexual maturity, whichever is later, at my own cost.

Transfer of Ownership: 
	I acknowledge and agree that the ownership and responsibility for the Pet belongs solely to me. In the event that I am unable to care for the Pet as required under this agreement, I shall contact Real Care Small Animal Clinic to assist in finding the Pet another adopter. I will allow Real Care Small Animal Clinic reasonable time to arrange for a suitable adopter for the Pet and shall inform Real Care Small Animal Clinic of any problems that the Pet might have at that point in time. I agree that I shall not sell, give, adopt out, or transfer ownership of the Pet without the prior approval from Real Care Small Animal Clinic. I also agree that this animal will not be acquired as a surprise gift.

Visit Rights: 
	I acknowledge and agree that any representative of Real Care Small Animal Clinic may contact me for verification of the Pet’s welfare. 

I also agree to:
(a) cooperate and provide any information in relation to the Pet which may be requested by Real Care Small Animal Clinic;
(b) permit any representative of Real Care Small Animal Clinic to visit the regular home of the Pet;
(c) Keep Real Care Small Animal Clinic informed of any and all changes in my residential address, email address or contact numbers; and notify Real Care Small Animal Clinic immediately if the Pet becomes lost.

Compliance with Laws: 
	I hereby agree to comply with all laws in force in connection with owning the Pet. Where the Pet is a dog, I agree to legally license the Pet within 30 days from the date of adoption.

Breach: 
	I acknowledge and agree that in the event of any breach of the above terms and conditions, Real Care Small Animal Clinic shall have the right, at its discretion, to confiscate the Pet from me, report the breach to the relevant authorities or take further legal action and/or pay the said amount as a penalty.
