Hello ji, Hi,
we met a long time ago.
days are passing one by one and we are growing old together
Each passing day brings new threts as well as challanges.
Inorder to face the threts and accepting challenges I am loosing my consiousness
the person for which i am doing everything is the same person i am yelling abusing and shouthing
when i got a little bit of free space I always thought about my behaviour with everyone
is it fair with that person?. I guess no...
The days passed climate changed, places changed experiences changed even people also changed
but one thing which is constant in my life is you and I dont want to loose you
I know that you in yourself is too much variable and start to think different things but thats our nature
what to do how to do when to do where to do and finding individual reasons behind it 
but I will find definately and I want you to be with me.
